 This is Hydra, a modification of Boa, which supports multiple threads of 
execution. Boa is a high performance web server for Unix-alike computers, 
covered by the Gnu General Public License.  This modification is based on 
Boa version 0.94.13, and is currently of alpha quality.

Why Hydra? Well, Lernean Hydra was a nine headed, monstrous serpent in 
Greek Mythology, and seemed to resemble fine a multi-threaded Boa. An 
interesting feature of Hydra is that a head, when cut off was replaced by 
two others. This was not duplicated in Hydra's threads!


***** Configure time parameters

 --disable-ssl: Disables SSL and TLS support. You must have the gnutls library
    for SSL to work.

 --disable-smp: Disables all of the thread stuff. Hydra will function just like
    Boa.

 --disable-hic: HIC is a special hydra thread that handles scripting languages
    such as PHP. Use this parameter to disable this feature.


***** Development
