# Hydra v0.0.2 configuration file
# File format has is similar but no identical to the format of Boa v0.94
# version changes are noted in the comments
#
# The Hydra configuration file is parsed with a lex/yacc or flex/bison
# generated parser.  If it reports an error, the line number will be
# provided; it should be easy to spot.  The syntax of each of these
# rules is very simple, and they can occur in any order.  Where possible
# these directives mimic those of NCSA httpd 1.3; I saw no reason to 
# introduce gratuitous differences.

# ServerRoot: The directory the .html (and related) files are placed.

# number of threads to spawn
# One thread might be ok for a single CPU system, but in some systems, 
# performance may be increased by using a pool of 4-5 threads.

# Maximum number of concurent connections. If connections arrive after
# the given limit has been reached, then they will not be served, until
# some established connections close. If you do not set it, or set it to
# 0, then the default behaviour takes effect, which is to try to serve
# as much connections as possible (depends on system limits).
#MaxConnections 0

# Port: The port Hydra runs on.  The default port for http servers is 80.
# If it is less than 1024, the server must be started as root.

Port 80

# Listen: the Internet address to bind(2) to.  If you leave it out,
# it takes the behavior before 0.93.17.2, which is to bind to all
# addresses (INADDR_ANY).  You only get one "Listen" directive,
# if you want service on multiple IP addresses, you have three choices:
#    1. Run hydra without a "Listen" directive
#       a. All addresses are treated the same; makes sense if the addresses
#          are localhost, ppp, and eth0.
#       b. Use the VirtualHost directive below to point requests to different
#          files.  Should be good for a very large number of addresses (web
#          hosting clients).
#    2. Run one copy of hydra per IP address, each has its own configuration
#       with a "Listen" directive.  No big deal up to a few tens of addresses.
#       Nice separation between clients.
# The name you provide gets run through inet_aton(3), so you have to use dotted
# quad notation.  This configuration is too important to trust some DNS.

#Listen 192.68.0.5

#  User: The name or UID the server should run as.
# Group: The group name or GID the server should run as.

# UserDir is the name of the directory which is appended onto a user's home

#
# Note that if VirtualHost is enabled, this will be the fallback
# for the clients that did not supply any host.

# DirectoryIndex: Name of the file to use as a pre-written HTML

MimeTypes /etc/mime.types

# DefaultType: MIME type used if the file extension is unknown, or there

CGIPath /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin

# SinglePostLimit: The maximum allowable number of bytes in 
# a single POST.  Default is normally 1MB.

# AddType: adds types without editing mime.types
# Example: AddType type extension [extension ...]

# Uncomment the next line if you want .cgi files to execute from anywhere
#AddType application/x-httpd-cgi cgi


# Use this if you want CGIs to execute from anywhere, using the CGIAction.

# Redirect, Alias, and ScriptAlias all have the same semantics -- they
# match the beginning of a request and take appropriate action.  Use
# Redirect for other servers, Alias for the same server, and ScriptAlias
# to enable directories for script execution.

# The first argument of Redirect and friends is the virtual server hostname,
# and the directive only applies to the given virtual server. If the directive
# equals "" then the default server is assumed.

# Redirect allows you to tell clients about documents which used to exist in
# your server's namespace, but do not anymore. This allows you to tell the
# clients where to look for the relocated document.
# Example: Redirect www.ourhost.com /bar http://elsewhere/feh/bar

# Aliases: Aliases one path to another.
# Example: Alias www.ourhost.com /path1/bar /absolute/path2/foo

#Alias www.localhost.com /doc /usr/doc

# ScriptAlias: Maps a virtual path to a directory for serving scripts
# Example: ScriptAlias www.ourhost.com /htbin/ /www/htbin/

#ScriptAlias www.localhost.com /cgi-bin/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/

# Access Control lists per virtual host
# These two directives (Allow/Deny), allow you to specify file

# of these directives is a virtual host.

# deny all files that start with a dot in the default host
#Deny "" */.*

# deny all the files that finish with '.inc' in www.localhost.com virtual
# host, but allow access to the public.inc.
#Deny "www.localhost.com" */*.inc
