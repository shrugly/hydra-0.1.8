Core
  Add more of HTTP/1.1 features.
  Improve HTTP/1.1 ranges to support multiple values
     such as bytes="10-15,16-20,50-100".
  Improve the parameter regeneration (hack) in TLS/SSL.
  Add support for virtual hosting in TLS, and support for
     openpgp keys.
  Add rewrite rules. Probably using libpcre.
  Add FastCGI support.
  Rewrite virtual host code.
  Rewrite error reporting to client:
     - Virtual Host defined error pages
     - Global server error pages
     - Bulitin error pages
  Rewrite hash.c ( allow arbitrary data in cache, not only *char )
     Only cache framework in hash.c. Service specyfic code in diffrent 
     files.
  Cleanup in string.c. Kill dead code.
  Kill any access() occurences.
     Change all *sprintf to *snprintf ( more secure )
     Implement strlcpy() and strlcat() in string.c
     Change all strcpy/strncpy/strcat/strncat to strlcpy/strlcat ( more secure )
  Bulitin indexing ( spawning CGI is very, very slow... ;( )
     Caching indexes in memory(or disk), recacheing when client 
     sends "Pragma: no_cache".
     Dumping cached entries from memory when timeout has expired.
  Authorization ( with modules ).
  Drop support for those '#ifdef ENABLE_SMP'. SMP should be
     always on. [only idea] 
     [also check how to work on systems that do not support threads -- 
      openbsd should be one]

Config
  Rewrite configuration file parser to allow blocks of directives.

Documentation
  Need lots of :-) .

Miscellaneous
  Change boa_* functions to be hydra_* functions :-) .
