FINAL RESULTS:

./src/alias.c:417:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
./src/alias.c:430:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
./src/alias.c:431:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).
./src/alias.c:447:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw. If an attacker can change anything
  along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual use
  (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race condition
  (CWE-362/CWE-367!). Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid())
  and try to open the file directly.
./src/alias.c:653:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
./src/boa.c:444:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination
  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or
  snprintf (warning: strncat is easily misused).
./src/boa_grammar.c:405:  [4] (format) fprintf:

  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
./src/boa_grammar.c:966:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).

  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.

  [MS-banned] (CWE-120). Consider using strcat_s, strncat, strlcat, or

  easily misused).
./src/request.c:1041:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).

  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.

  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
./src/boa.c:84:  [3] (buffer) getopt:
  Some older implementations do not protect against internal buffer overflows
  (CWE-120, CWE-20). Check implementation on installation, or limit the size
  of all string inputs.
./src/boa.c:101:  [3] (misc) chroot:
  chroot can be very helpful, but is hard to use correctly (CWE-250, CWE-22).
  Make sure the program immediately chdir("/"), closes file descriptors, and
  drops root privileges, and that all necessary files (and no more!) are in
  the new root.
./src/config.c:363:  [3] (buffer) getenv:
  Environment variables are untrustable input if they can be set by an
  attacker. They can have any content and length, and the same variable can
  be set more than once (CWE-807, CWE-20). Check environment variables
  carefully before using them.
