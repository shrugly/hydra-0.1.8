[Hydra](http://hydra.hellug.gr/) is a lightweight, multithreaded HTTP server which is occasionally still found in embedded firmware images for serving CGI scripts, files, and more. 0.1.8 is the last stable version, and was released [in 2006](http://hydra.hellug.gr/download/).

## Changes

This repository contains Hydra 0.1.8. It should not be considered meaningfully enhanced from the original source.

### Integrations

- [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/) - performs QL-based quality and security checks on the main repository as well as any PRs to help identify & track security hotspots.
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) - builds Boa on Linux and macOS with GCC & Clang to ensure that changes don't immediately introduce quality issues.

## SHRuG Creed

We apply security tools & processes to assist developers in determining if legacy software is the right choice for their application. Where reasonable we will attempt to upgrade the security, reliability, and quality of legacy software.

However, we are not volunteering to be new maintainers for this software. We will not develop new features or substantially change its functionality. Please report bugs that result in security problems to us using the [Issues](https://github.com/shrugly/hydra-0.1.8/issues) tab and we will look into fixing them. Other bugs, feature requests, usability issues, etc. will be largely ignored or closed without warning.
